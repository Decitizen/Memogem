When I was a young mathematics student in the early 1950s I did not read a great deal, but what I did read at least if I
completed the book was usually by Erwin Schrödinger. I always found his writing to be compelling, and there was an
excitement of discovery, with the prospect of gaining some genuinely new understanding about this mysterious world in
which we live. None of his writings possesses more of this quality than his short classic What is Life? which, as I now
realize, must surely rank among the most influential of scientific writings in this century. It represents a powerful
attempt to comprehend some of the genuine mysteries of life, made by a physicist whose own deep insights had done so
much to change the way in which we understand what the world is made of. The book's cross-disciplinary sweep was
unusual for its time yet it is written with an endearing, if perhaps disarming, modesty, at a level that makes it accessible
to non-specialists and to the young who might aspire to be scientists. Indeed, many scientists who have made
fundamental contributions in biology, such as J. B. S. Haldane and Francis Crick, have admitted to being strongly
influenced by (although not always in complete agreement with) the broad-ranging ideas put forward here by this highly
original and profoundly thoughtful physicist.

Like so many works that have had a great impact on human thinking, it makes points that, once they are grasped, have a
ring of almost self-evident truth; yet they are still blindly ignored by a disconcertingly large proportion of people who
should know better. How often do we still hear that quantum effects can have little relevance in the study of biology, or
even that we eat food in order to gain energy? This serves to emphasize the continuing relevance that Schrödinger's
What is Life? has for us today. It is amply worth rereading!
