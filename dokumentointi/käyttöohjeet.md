##Welcome to MemoGem’s user manual 
MemoGem is a learning software designed to make your life easier and enhance your learning experience.
MemoGem is basically a tuned up and computerized version of age old learning technique: flashcards. 
MemoGem can help you to easily learn new languages, memorize words and concepts or even learn music theory. MemoGem’s learning engine is based on learning technique called “active recall testing” which involves recalling answers to questions. Compared to passive learning such as reading active recalling engages the brain’s learning capabilities constantly and makes possible for people to learn and memorize things more efficiently. MemoGem also offers large amount of tightly packed and thoroughly analyzed data of your studies and will augment the learning experience further.

##MemoGem’s Main Window (Control Panel)
###From the top to bottom:
####Menu-bar: 
(Top left) Includes: “File”, “Options” and “Study Mode”-drop down menus.
For now the “File”-menu only supports “Exit” function. Click “File” and “Exit” from the drop-down menu to exit program. 
Options is not yet supported. 

In “Study Mode”-menu you can select from three different modes of study (left-mouse-click to select):
1. “By Difficulty”
In this mode set is ordered according to most difficult cards and in descending order. In order to gain maximum efficiency and learning rate, the easier cards are filtered out of this study session. 
2. “By Least Studied” – 
In this mode set is ordered according to cards which have been studied least (in ascending order). Includes all the cards.
3. “Fresh”
This mode of study fully randomizes the order of the cards in the set.

####Choose topic:
Here you can choose from different study-topics. The drop-down list shows all the different sets currently available (left-mouse-click to select). 
Hint: Changing topic also changes the textual statistics right under this section as well as the “Time statistics”-chart on the right side of the screen. 

####Textual statistics:

“Cards” - the overall amount of cards in the set.
“Date Last Studied” – last time any of the set’s card’s were studied.
“Difficulty” – average difficulty of the set based on your own self-evaluations
####Graphical statistics:
Aggregate Time Studied: this pie-chart shows how the time duration of your overall study has been shared between different topics.

####Time Statistics
Y-axis represents average time spend for each review of card (in seconds). Each dot on the graph stands for different card. Cards are scaled by their amount so that the result is as evenly distributed as possible. Red area stands for averaged time over all of the study times, whereas orange stands for just the last three study-rounds.
On the bottom there are three buttons: 
Add Card: (left-mouse-click) opens new window where you can write a new card. You can add text to the front of the card as well as to the back. Arbitrary amount of tags are allowed per card.
Study Set: (left-mouse-click) Takes you to the study window.

###How to study effectively:
Choose topic according to your wishes from the drop-down menu under the “Choose topic”-text. Choose the suitable study mode from the top menu-bar (left-mouse-click). Press “Study Set”-button in order to begin the study round. New window opens up. The study session follows following procedure:

####You will be shown the first flashcard’s front-side.
####When you have recalled the answer/pair to the front’s text, press ”Show Answer”.
####Answer will be shown. When ready to move forward, press one of the three cards “Again” “Good” “Easy”. This will help Memogem’s learning engine to optimize the current round of cards for the future. After this the next card will be shown. Now study away!

In the end MemoGem will notify you when the round ends. Here you can also choose to study more or to go back to the main window.
